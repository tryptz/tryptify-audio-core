/**
 * WSOLA — waveform-similarity overlap-add.
 *
 * ## Why this and not a phase vocoder
 *
 * The job is to change how long a sample takes to play without changing what
 * it sounds like. Resampling cannot do it: reading faster raises the pitch,
 * which is varispeed — useful, and offered as its own mode, but not the same
 * thing.
 *
 * WSOLA cuts the source into overlapping grains and lays them back down at a
 * different spacing. The "similarity" part is the whole trick: before laying
 * each grain down it searches a small neighbourhood for the position whose
 * waveform best continues what was already written, so successive grains stay
 * phase-aligned and the overlap does not comb-filter. Laying grains down at
 * fixed positions — plain SOLA — cancels partials wherever the phases happen
 * to disagree, and sounds like a flanger nobody asked for.
 *
 * A phase vocoder would be better on sustained polyphonic material and much
 * worse here: it needs an FFT per grain, it smears transients (the "phasiness"
 * that makes stretched drums sound like wet cardboard), and a sampler is
 * mostly pointed at drums. WSOLA is cheap enough to run per voice on the audio
 * thread, which a phase vocoder is not.
 *
 * ## Stereo
 *
 * Both channels are spliced at the *same* offset, chosen by correlating the
 * mid signal (L+R). Running two independent stretchers instead would let the
 * channels pick different splice points, and since the offset is what sets the
 * phase of everything in the grain, the image would swim between the speakers
 * on every grain boundary — audible as a wandering, unstable stereo picture.
 * Correlating the mid rather than the left channel alone matters for material
 * where one side is momentarily silent: a hard-panned fill would otherwise be
 * spliced against nothing.
 *
 * ## Real-time contract
 *
 * Everything is a fixed-size member. No allocation, no locks, no I/O. The
 * search is a bounded correlation over [kWsolaOverlap] samples across
 * `2 * searchRadius + 1` offsets, so the worst case per grain is known ahead
 * of time and does not depend on the audio.
 *
 * Cost is roughly `2 * searchRadius * kWsolaOverlap / hop` multiply-adds per
 * output sample — about 128 at BALANCED and 256 at HIGH. It is a dot product
 * over contiguous floats, which is the one shape a compiler reliably
 * vectorises.
 *
 * Bypassed entirely at unity ratio — see [Voice], where a voice that is
 * neither stretched nor pitched reads the sample directly. Nothing here runs
 * for the common case of a sample played as recorded.

     * musically (1024 and 1000 samples are the same grain) and lets every
     * window share one Hann table exactly.
     *
     * The search radius is the parameter that actually decides how low the
     * stretcher works, and it is easy to set too small. To splice without a
     * phase discontinuity the search has to be able to reach a whole period of
     * the frequency being spliced, so the lowest frequency it can hold
     * together is `sampleRate / searchRadius`. At 48 kHz:

     *
     * Anything below that floor still stretches, but its pitch wanders,
     * because the splices land mid-cycle and eat or add partial periods. A
     * 110 Hz bass note through a 128-sample radius measures about 8% flat —
